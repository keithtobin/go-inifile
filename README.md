# go-inifile #

go-inifile is a Go library for creating, modifying, reading and writing ini files.

go-inifile requires Go version 1.1 or greater.

## Inspiration ##
The inspiration for this library came from the requirement to be able to easily create, modify, read and write Openstack ini files.

## Getting started ##
TBD: I will add docs, a getting started guide and example in the comming days.

## License ##
This library is distributed under the GPL.
